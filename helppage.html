<p>This application is designed to display unemployment percentage rates by US state and county, and update according to user intention.</p>

<div style="background-color: #00fA9A; width: 100%; height: 100px; border-radius: 3px;">Change your chart title by entering new name in the box, press "Update" button at bottom.  Update the unemployment range you wish to view, press "Update" to use this new range to modify your chart.  Select which states to view; use the list, delete (or backspace) to remove ones you no longer wish to see, begin typing first letters for quicker lookup.  As with all other changes, pressing "Update" refreshes the chart and table. Displaying fewer states allows for closer zoom.  Enjoy!!

<div style="background-color: #D8BFD8; width: 100%; height: 100px; border-radius: 3px;">Mini Tutorial:  Try setting some of your own parameters.  Examples: To see Ohio counties with unemployment over 8%, set the sliders to 8 and 24, choose state Ohio.  Or low unemployment in Alabama and Georgia -- set sliders to 0 and 10, delete Ohio (using backspace or delete), and add Alabama and Georgia.  Find your own state or region of interest!
